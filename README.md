## My process

Initially I thought about setting up the grid first creating a huge mess. Then after many days of struggling I found a video (link below) with a possible correct procedure which started from the single cells in the mobile version, and it helped me a lot. I realized that my first big mistake was trying to think having a desktop perspective first rather than a mobile perspective. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to create a responsive grid thanks to the "grid-template-areas", starting from a mobile perspective, looking at each single cells rather than building the structure of the grid right away from the beginning.
- I realized that nesting selectors inside other ones creates some problematic situations. 

### Continued development

I think I am still missing the whole workflow for slightly bigger projects like this. I saw some video about it and I'm still having issues setting up correctly all the elements for a smooth workflow, especially I should get more used to declare generic selectors in order to write less and cleaner code.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4dHvo09cG4) - This was basically the solution, but I tried to take the least possible things from it.
